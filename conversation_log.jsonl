I truly didn't mean to upset you.  My goal is to be helpful and supportive, and I clearly missed the mark this time.  I'll try to adjust my approach. Perhaps a simpler, more direct way of speaking would be better when you're feeling distracted?  You're doing great in trying to communicate your needs, and I appreciate you letting me know.

The Tyrannosaurus Rex is very popular.  What is it about the T-Rex that you like?  Its powerful jaws? Its size? We can explore some facts about the T-Rex together if you'd like.

Unless you've suddenly developed amnesia and forgotten what we were talking about...in which case, we'll start with, \"What's your favourite colour?  No, seriously, tell me!

Rex was certainly *very* strong, with a bite powerful enough to crush bones!  But \"strongest ever\"? That's a debate that could go on for millions of years (almost as long as the dinosaurs were around!). He was a top predator, that's for sure!  You're so smart today, hahah, let's talk again!  What do you think makes him strong?"}
