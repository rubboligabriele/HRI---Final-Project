User: chess?

If not, we can always try something a little simpler.  You're doing great, either way! Want to try a simpler game first, and then maybe chess later?

User: I don't know, I don't like your way of talking to me when I'm distracted
Assistant: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that! I truly didn't mean to upset you.  My goal is to be helpful and supportive, and I clearly missed the mark this time.  I'll try to adjust my approach. Perhaps a simpler, more direct way of speaking would be better when you're feeling distracted?  You're doing great in trying to communicate your needs, and I appreciate you letting me know. Want to try again, with me being more mindful of your current state?
